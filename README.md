# TMA4135 Matematikk 4D

Solutions to exercises for the course TMA4135 Fall 2017.

These are mainly for personal use - don't be fooled by the formatting, the solutions are those of a student (I don't really know what I'm doing).

Feel free to open up an issue or a pull request if you find a mistake, it is appreciated.

Some exercises are incomplete or might be very wrong.
